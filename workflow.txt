Step-by-Step Explanation of FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for a TODO Application:

1. Creating the database.py file:
   - We created an `engine`. The engine acts as an API bridge where:
     - Python code goes into the engine.
     - The engine converts it into SQL.
     - The SQL interacts with the database table.
     - The result from the table goes back through the engine and is converted into Python objects.
   - Example: Queries, inserts, or updates in Python are handled via the engine.

2. Creating `SessionLocal`:
   - This is a factory that helps us create a session every time we talk to the database.
   - `bind=engine` ensures that every session created will talk to the specific database defined by the engine.
   - Sessions allow:
     - Querying data.
     - Adding, updating, or deleting records.
     - Committing or rolling back transactions.

3. Creating `Base`:
   - We created `Base = declarative_base()` as the foundation for SQLAlchemy ORM.
   - This acts as the base class for defining database models (tables).
   - Every model (table) we define will inherit from this `Base`.

4. Creating the Todos model:
   - In `models.py`, we created the `Todos` model to represent a table in the database.
   - Fields in the model, like `id`, `title`, `description`, etc., correspond to the columns in the database table.
   - Each instance of `Todos` represents a row in the database.

5. Creating the database:
   - In `main.py`, we used the following code:
     ```
     models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
     ```
   - This command:
     - Looks at all the models defined with `Base` (like `Todos`).
     - Translates them into SQL `CREATE TABLE` commands.
     - Executes those commands in the database to create the tables.

6. Defining `get_db` function:
   - This function manages sessions:
     ```
     def get_db():
         db = sessionLocal()
         try:
             yield db
         finally:
             db.close()
     ```
   - What it does:
     - Creates a session for interacting with the database.
     - Yields the session to API logic.
     - Ensures the session is closed after the API logic finishes, even if an error occurs.
   - Why itâ€™s needed:
     - Each request gets its own isolated session to avoid data conflicts or shared states.

7. Dependency Injection:
   - We used dependency injection to ensure the database session (`db`) is available for each API endpoint.
   - Example:
     ```
     db_dependency = Annotated[Session, Depends(get_db)]
     ```
   - This ensures that:
     - A new session is created before the API logic runs.
     - The session is used for database communication in the endpoint.
     - The session is automatically closed afterward.

8. API Logic:
   - The remaining API logic performs operations like creating, reading, updating, or deleting `Todos`.
   - Each endpoint:
     - Uses the `db_dependency` for interacting with the database.
     - Validates input using Pydantic models (e.g., `TodoRequest`).
     - Returns appropriate responses, like status codes and JSON data.
