from database import Base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean


'''
When you inherit Base, you tell SQLAlchemy that this class (Todos) is a database table.
It automatically connects your Python class to the database table.
It ensures that SQLAlchemy knows how to generate SQL commands for this class.

Without inheriting Base, SQLAlchemy wonâ€™t recognize the class as a database model.

# Defining the Todos model, which represents the 'todos' table in the database
'''
An index in a database is a data structure (usually a B-tree or hash table) that allows the database to quickly 
locate rows without having to scan every single row in the table.

    __tablename__ = 'todos'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True, index=True)
    title = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    description = Column(String(200), nullable=False)
    priority = Column(Integer)
